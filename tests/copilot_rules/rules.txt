When generating code try to follow the following coding style:
1. Use `import lib as l` and `l.fun` instead of `from lib import fun`.
2. State parameters data types explicitely.
3. Place constants into variables/arrays/maps

When running a python code use the venv virual environment that is already in directory. i.e. `source venv/bin/activate`.
