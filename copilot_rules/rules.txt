When generating code try to follow the following coding style:
1. Use `import lib as l` and `l.fun` instead of `from lib import fun`.
2. State parameters data types explicitely.
3. Place constants into variables/arrays/maps

When running a python code use the venv virual environment that is already in directory. i.e. `source venv/bin/activate`.
Run all tests in the tests directory using pytest when you are finished with the modifications.

SQLite DB that is used in `result_DAO.py` is called `state database`.

Context manager style:
- Use `get_conn_ctx()` from `src/connection_DAO.py` to acquire DB connections.
- The context manager commits on successful exit, rolls back on exceptions, and always closes the connection.
- Avoid calling `conn.commit()` inside functions that use `get_conn_ctx()`; it's handled by the manager.
